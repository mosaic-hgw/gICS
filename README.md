# IT-Security Recommendations #
Access to relevant application and database servers of the Trusted Third Party tools should only be possible for authorised personnel and via authorised end devices. We therefore recommend additionally implementing the following IT security measures:

* Operation of the relevant servers in separate network zones (separate from the research and supply network).
* Use of firewalls and IP filters
* Access restriction at URL level with Basic Authentication (e.g. with NGINX or Apache)
* use of Keycloak to restrict access to Web-Frontends and technical interfaces

# Additional Information #

The gICS was developed by the University Medicine Greifswald and published in 2014 as part of the [MOSAIC-Project](https://ths-greifswald.de/mosaic "")  (funded by the DFG HO 1937/2-1). Selected
functionalities of gICS were developed as part of the following research projects:

- MAGIC (funded by the DFG HO 1937/5-1)
- MIRACUM (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 01ZZ1801M)
- NUM-CODEX (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 01KX2021)
